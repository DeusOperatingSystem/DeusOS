## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please report it directly to DeusOperatingSystem@protonmail.com as descriptively and technically as possible in order to ensure there is no misunderstandings.

Regardless if the reported vulnerability is accepted or declined, you can expect a reply within three to four business day of our opinion of the vulnerability and its status on whether or not it was accepted.
If your report was accepted, you can expect an update regarding the vulnerability within a week or a month depending on the scale of the issue. If it is not seen as a major issue and does not pose any security risks to the system or user's private information, it will still be noted, but will be declined for being included for a hotfix.
